                a.x = newVoxel.x + this.rand.nextDouble();
                a.y = newVoxel.y + this.rand.nextDouble();
                a.z = newVoxel.z + this.rand.nextDouble();
shuld be x_root ...


Neutrophil lack "public int get_max_conidia()" method

Pneumocytes move is not returning anything! should return false!
